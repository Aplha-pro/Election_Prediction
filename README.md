<h1>Pakistan 2024 Election Prediction Project</h1>
<p>The AI Students present the Pakistan 2024 Election Prediction Project, a comprehensive endeavor aimed at predicting election outcomes using advanced analytical techniques. This workshop is designed to provide participants with insights into the methodologies employed and the intricacies of predictive analysis.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Our project initially utilized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to analyze sequential data pertinent to election trends. However, due to similarities in winning and losing probabilities, we transitioned to logistic regression, which proved to be more effective in handling the nuances of the data. Additionally, we leveraged social media data to extract semantic insights into public sentiment towards the election, enriching our predictive models.</p>

<h2>Methodologies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>LSTM Analysis:</strong> Utilized LSTM models for analyzing sequential election data.</li>
<li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Adopted logistic regression for improved prediction accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Mining:</strong> Extracted semantic data from social media platforms to gauge public sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization with Power BI:</strong> Employed Power BI for creating insightful visualizations to aid in data analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive analysis of Pakistan's 2024 Election dynamics.</li>
<li>Integration of multiple analytical techniques for robust predictions.</li>
<li>Insights into public sentiment derived from social media data.</li>
<li>Clear and concise visualizations created using Power BI.</li>
</ul>
